# RGB Generator

This project allows users to generate RGB colors by adjusting individual red, green, and blue input values. As the inputs are adjusted, the background color of the page changes to reflect the new color, and the RGB color code can be copied.

## Features

- **Individual RGB Inputs**: Users can adjust the red, green, and blue values separately.
- **Dynamic Background Color**: The background color changes in real-time as the RGB values are adjusted.
- **Color Code Display**: The RGB color code is displayed and can be copied easily.
- **Responsive Design**: The project is designed to be responsive, allowing users to access it from various devices.

## Usage

1. Adjust the red, green, and blue input values to generate a color.
2. The background color will change dynamically based on the RGB values.
3. Copy the displayed RGB color code as needed.
